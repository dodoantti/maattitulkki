MaattiTulkki is a software made to run a 2 relay board with Arduino which is
connected to a computer running MaattiWare http://maattiware.sourceforge.net/
via parallel port.

Original hardware implementation specified in MaattiWare is fine for running
low voltage vending machines, but in this usecase relays had to be connected
to 230V logic (relays and mains current), so relay board with optical isolation 
was needed.

Hardware used is Arduino Nano clone and cheap chinese 2 relay board.
Relay board wouldn't work with serial signal, so arduino is used to
run the relay board according to signals from MaattiWare.
